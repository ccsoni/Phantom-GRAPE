This library accelerates the calculation of quadrupole terms in the 
Barnes-Hut tree code by use of a SIMD instruction set on the x86 
architecture, Advanced Vector eXtensions 2 (AVX2). This library is 
implemented as an extension of the original Phantom-GRAPE that 
significantly accelerates the calculation of monopole terms. This 
package also includes sample code of the Barnes-Hut tree which utilize 
up to quadrupole terms.

The papers at the top, the middle, and the bottom describe this library, 
Phantom-GRAPE for collisionless simulations, and Phantom-GRAPE for 
collisional simulations, respectively.

Following is the directory tree of this package.

|__ quad ........... the library for calculation of quadrupole with AVX2

Below is the usage of the sample code.

1. Import "setting.mk" file and "libpg5" directory from 
   "Phantom-GRAPE/PG5/newton" directory, and "gp5util.h" file from 
   "Phantom-GRAPE/PG5/newton/libpg5" directory into the root directory 
   of this package.

2. In "setting.mk" file which is imported, edit the line 
   "enable_openmp=no" to "enable_openmp=yes".

3. In the root directory of this package, run "make" command to compile 
   the sample code.

4. Run the sample code by the following command.
    ---------------------------------
   ./source <FILENAME> 
    ---------------------------------
   <FILENAME> must be the name of a NEMO ASCII N-body snapshot file.

5. Input parameters by standard input. The order of the parameters is as
   follows; the number of particles, the time step, the finish time, 
   the interval of times to output virial ratio (t_out), the softening 
   length, theta, ncrit, and nleaf.

6. The sample code outputs the following data to standard output.
  a. Parameters used in the simulation.
  b. Time, the virial ratio, the relative error of energy in the first, 
     second, and third row, respectively. Those data are outputted only 
     when time / t_out = 0.
  c. The total energy in the initial condition and that in the final 
     condition.
  d. The wall clock time for total, tree construction, tree traversal, 
     and force calculation.
